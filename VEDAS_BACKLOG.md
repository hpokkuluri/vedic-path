# The Vedas — backlog

A "Vedas / వేదాలు" tile: six books, each a set of chapters in the same paged reader as the Rāmāyaṇa
(`vedas.js`, one file per book in `vedas/`). A daily scheduled task writes **one book per day**, starting
Wednesday 2026-10-21, taking the first unchecked book under "Next".

## What Hari asked for (read this first)

- **Easy to understand, like the Rāmāyaṇa.** Many readers — Hari included — do not know what the Vedas are,
  why they matter, or what relevance they have today. Write for that reader: a curious adult or a child of
  10+, who has heard the word "Veda" but nothing more. Explain every Sanskrit term the first time it is used.
- **No verses.** Do not use `sloka` blocks, and do not quote Sanskrit lines. Explain ideas in plain words.
  A famous short phrase may be named inside a sentence with its meaning when it really helps
  (e.g. "Satyameva Jayate — truth alone wins"), at most once or twice a book.
- **Tell it through stories and pictures-in-words** wherever possible: the Upaniṣad stories, the people who
  preserved the Vedas, what happens at a real yajña or upanayanam, a family chanting at dawn.
- English and Telugu for every block. Telugu must be natural and simple, the way Telugu families speak.
- Fresh wording from the original texts and well-established facts. Never copy or closely follow any modern
  book, translation, website or video. Where scholars and tradition differ (dates, authorship), give both
  plainly and respectfully. Never invent a story, a reference or a statistic.
- Credit line "Written by Hari Pokkuluri" appears automatically on chapter 1 of each book.

## How a book file is built

- `vedas/<key>.js` adds `window.VEDA_PLAN.<key>` (chapter titles and short source labels) and appends to
  `window.VEDA_CHAPTERS`. Copy the object shape of a chapter in `sages/vasishtha.js`, but use `book: '<key>'`
  instead of `sage`. Chapter `id` = `<prefix>-<n>` (prefixes: intro `vi`, rig `vr`, yajur `vy`, sama `vs`,
  atharva `va2`, life `vl`); `order` = book position (1–6) × 100 + n; `date` = today (America/New_York).
- 8–12 chapters a book, 3–5 pages a chapter. Blocks: `p`, `h`, `dyk`, `more`, `src` (one on the last page of
  every chapter), `link` (Rāmāyaṇa chapter id, e.g. `bala-5`), `sglink` (Great Sages chapter id, e.g. `an-8`),
  `vdlink` (another Vedas chapter). Link to existing sage and Rāmāyaṇa chapters instead of retelling them.
  Give each chapter `remember` (3 lines) and `think` (one question). `who` and `{key|Name}` links may use
  existing `RMY_WHO` keys; add new ones with `window.RMY_WHO = Object.assign({...new}, window.RMY_WHO || {})`.
- Wire each file in: `<script src="vedas/<key>.js"></script>` in `index.html` just before
  `<script src="vedas.js"></script>`; add `'./vedas/<key>.js'` to `SHELL` in `sw.js` and bump `CACHE`.
- **First run only (when `vedas/` does not exist yet):** also add the home tile in `index.html`'s library
  `texts` list, right after the `sages` tile:
  `{ key:'vedas', icon:'🕉️', name:'The Vedas', desc:'Vedālu · explained simply', action:"openVedas()", gradient:'linear-gradient(160deg,#3a1406,#c0601c)', dot:'#c0601c', tradition:'Veda' },`
  and a top-bar tab after the Sages tab: `<button class="stab" data-sec="vedas" onclick="openVedas()">Vedas</button>`.
  The views, routing, `vedas.js` script tag and service-worker entry are already in place.
- `node tools/check_vedas.js` must print OK (it rejects `sloka` blocks).

## Next

- [ ] The Vedas in Our Life (life) — where the Vedas still touch a Hindu family's day: Om; sandhyāvandanam and the Gāyatrī; the sixteen saṃskāras from naming to marriage to the last rites, and which Veda each comes from; the wedding — the seven steps, Agni as witness, Arundhatī's star (link va-2); the upanayanam; gotra and pravara (link an-11); temple worship and the Vedic chanting there; the pañcāṅga and the Vedic calendar; Āyurveda, yoga, music and architecture; what the Vedas teach about the environment, truth, giving, and living in harmony; how anyone can begin to learn — chanting, reading in translation, listening; and why it matters for the next generation.
