# Great Sages — backlog

The Great Sages tile (`sages.js`, one file per sage in `sages/`). A daily scheduled task takes the
**first unchecked** sage under "Next", writes that sage's complete life, publishes it, and moves it to
"Done" in the same commit.

## What Hari asked for

- The **full** life of each sage — "big stories, nothing hidden", for kids and adults alike.
  Include every major episode the sources tell, including hard ones (curses, killings, wrongs done
  to women, the sage's own failures). Tell difficult events plainly and without graphic detail.
  No separate kids' version.
- English and Telugu for every block. Telugu must be natural, grammatical, the way Telugu families
  speak, with the usual Telugu names (రాముడు, సీతాదేవి, వసిష్ఠుడు, …).
- Written fresh in our own words from the original texts (Veda, Brāhmaṇas, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa,
  Mahābhārata, Purāṇas, Yoga Vāsiṣṭha, Kālidāsa and other pre-modern works). Never copy or closely
  follow any modern translation, comic, book, film or website.
- Where texts disagree, tell the main version and give the other(s), saying which text says what.
  Mark folk or later tellings as such ("later tellings say…"). Never invent an episode or a source.
  If unsure of a chapter/verse number, name the book and section without the number.
- Credit line "Retold by Hari Pokkuluri" appears automatically on chapter 1.

## How a sage file is built (copy the pattern of `sages/vasishtha.js`)

1. `window.SAGE_PLAN.<key>` — the list of chapter titles and sources (aim for 7–12 chapters).
2. `window.RMY_WHO` — add a name-sheet entry (`av, en, te, d, dt`) for every new person used in
   `who` or in `{key|Name}` links, using `Object.assign({...new}, window.RMY_WHO || {})` so existing
   entries win. Check `ramayana/*.js` and the other `sages/*.js` for keys that already exist.
3. `window.SAGE_CHAPTERS` — one object per chapter: `id` (`<prefix>-<n>`, prefix 2–3 letters and unique),
   `sage`, `n`, `order` (= the sage's position in the SAGES list in `sages.js` × 100 + n), `date`
   (today, America/New_York), `title`, `titleTe`, `src`, `who`, `pages` (3–5 pages of blocks),
   `remember` (3 lines), `think` (one question).
4. Block types (see the top of `ramayana.js` and `sages.js`): `p` paragraph, `h` sub-heading,
   `sloka` (Telugu-script lines, transliteration, meaning EN, meaning TE), `dyk` "Did you know?",
   `src` "Where this is told" (put one on the last page of every chapter), `more` tap-to-open box,
   `link` (opens a Rāmāyaṇa chapter id such as `bala-5`), `sglink` (opens another sage chapter).
   Use `sglink`/`link` where a story is already told in full elsewhere instead of retelling it.
   Only quote a Sanskrit verse when you are certain of its exact text.
5. Wire it in: `<script src="sages/<key>.js"></script>` in `index.html` just before
   `<script src="sages.js"></script>`; add `'./sages/<key>.js'` to `SHELL` in `sw.js` and bump `CACHE`.
6. `node tools/check_sages.js` must print OK.

## Next

- [ ] Lomaśa (lomasha) — the hairy sage who lives an age of Brahmā; Indra's messenger to the Pāṇḍavas; guiding them on the great pilgrimage and telling the tīrtha tales (Agastya, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, Bhagīratha, Cyavana); his hairs falling one per cycle (MBh Vana, later Purāṇas).
- [ ] Dhaumya (dhaumya) — priest of the Pāṇḍavas chosen at Utkocaka; the 108 names of Sūrya and the akṣaya-pātra; counsel before the year in disguise; the funeral rites after the war (MBh Ādi, Vana, Virāṭa, Strī).
- [ ] Upamanyu (upamanyu) — Dhaumya's cowherd pupil and the Aśvins' cure; the boy who wanted milk and was taught to seek Śiva; Śiva's test in Indra's form; teaching Kṛṣṇa the Śiva Sahasranāma (MBh Ādi, Anuśāsana, Liṅga Purāṇa).
- [ ] Sāndīpani (sandipani) — teacher of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma at Avantī; sixty-four arts in sixty-four days; the son lost to the sea and brought back from Yama's city as guru-dakṣiṇā (Bhāgavata 10, Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Harivaṃśa).
- [ ] The four Kumāras (kumaras) — Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana, Sanatkumāra, mind-born sons who refused to create; cursing Jaya and Vijaya at Vaikuṇṭha; Sanatkumāra teaching Nārada (Chāndogya) and Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Sanatsujātīya) (Bhāgavata, Chāndogya Upaniṣad, MBh Udyoga).

Add more when fewer than five remain: e.g. Pulastya, Kaṇva, Uttaṅka, Dhaumya, Lomaśa, Māṇḍavya,
Śuka, Jaimini, Vālakhilyas, the four Kumāras, Upamanyu, Āruṇi, Sāndīpani, Garga, Śāṇḍilya, Cyavana.
New sages also need a line in the SAGES list in `sages.js` (key, name, Telugu, known-for, Telugu,
icon, gradient) — add it at the end of the list.
